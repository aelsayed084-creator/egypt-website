    <h2 id="pyramids">The pyramids</h2>
    <p>The Egyptian pyramids are colossal ancient structures,
         primarily built as elaborate tombs for pharaohs and their consorts during the Old and Middle Kingdoms to ensure their passage to the afterlife and to demonstrate their power.
          The most famous are the pyramids at Giza—the Great Pyramid of Khufu, 
          and the pyramids of Khafre and Menkaure—which are also the last remaining of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. </p>

<h2 id="tower">The Cairo Tower</h2>
<p>The Cairo Tower is a 187-meter-high telecommunications tower and a prominent landmark in Cairo, Egypt, designed by Naoum Shebib and completed in 1961. Inspired by the lotus plant, 
    its design features a lattice-work structure with an observation deck and a revolving restaurant at the top, offering panoramic views of the city. 
    The tower was built on the Gezira island in the Zamalek district, and while it was once the tallest structure in Egypt,
     it remains a significant tourist destination and a symbol of national pride.</p>
